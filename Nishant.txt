Once upon a time, there was a man named John who loved playing practical jokes on his friends. One day, he decided to play a joke on his friend Bob by filling his office with balloons.

John snuck into Bob's office early in the morning and began blowing up dozens of balloons. He filled every nook and cranny of the room until there was hardly any space left to walk. Satisfied with his prank, John left the office and waited for Bob to arrive.

When Bob walked into his office, he was completely taken aback. He couldn't believe what he was seeing. His entire office was filled with balloons!
